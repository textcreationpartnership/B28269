            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Papists, those restless Enemies of the Protestant Religion, are not more infamous for the unsoundness of their Doctrines, than for the greatness of their Treasons: where they cannot convince, they labour to destroy; and rather than not subdue what they call (but cannot prove) a pestilent Heresie, they will massacre the whole Protestant Party; and will pull down a flourishing State, to build a corrupt Church.</p>
            <p>Their Subjection to the Pope is in consistent with their Allegiance to the Prince; and if they are true Roman Catholicks, they cannot be good English Subjects: For when they are designed by the Church to be made Saints, they never afterwards by the Law can be made Rebels.</p>
            <p>And therefore when God is pleased, by discovering their Designs, to expose them to Justice, there is not a man of them that is guilty, but as innocent as the Child unborn: For unless their attempts succeed, and declare to all the World their actual Treason, in despight of all other proofs, they will brag of their constant Loyalty.</p>
            <p>Willing enough they are to reap the fruits of Rebellion, but take care (if the case be hazardous) to avoid the Scandal: And therefore sometimes they stand behind the Curtain, while they spur on others (more adventrous, though no more wicked) to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Counsels; and by exposing them, secure themselves from the Censure and the Punishment.</p>
            <p>To be sure, when they have Power they never want Cruelty: The <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Pagans</hi> have been out-done by their greater Persecutions: The Stakes, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and the Fire bear witness against them.</p>
            <p>And when they have no strength, we know they want not malice, but labour by Treachery to undermine, when by Power they cannot subdue; His Majesty and our Religion have been brought into great danger by their secret Plots and Conspiracies; The unhappy Quarrels and Dissentions amongst our selves are Tares of their sowing.</p>
            <p>But if they want might or subtilty of their own, before they will desist, they will crave assistance from abroad; Foreign Powers shall be ingag'd to weaken us; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Popery should be kept out, they will truck for an Invasion.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is no Age, no place, but gives us too sad Examples of their Villanies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ither Acted or Contrived.</p>
            <p>Nor is it strange, when men call Evil Good, that they run into all excess of wickedness: With them 'tis lawful to tread upon the Royal Diadem to advance the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Crown; and meritorious to kill the Lords Anointed, who is really Gods Vicegerent, for the Interest of the Man of Sin, who falsly calls himself Christs Vicar.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that these fiery Zealots so often ingage to Assassinate Soveraign Princes, and imbroyl Peaceable Kingdoms.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:207717:3"/>
            <p>The proofs hereof are too plain, and one would think needless, but that the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Adversaries, that teaches them to deny the plainest Evidence, will not suffer them to confess the most apparent Crimes.</p>
            <p>Wonder not (Good Reader) at this their boldness! For 'tis the old Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick usage, under a deep guilt, to protest an unspotted Innocence; and then chiefly to declare that it is not lawful to depose, or murther the King, when they are not able, or want an opportunity.</p>
            <p>The truth is, 'tis no new thing for them, when they have done or intended evil, to wipe their mouths, and say they have done or intended nothing: <hi>Tresham</hi> (one of the Gunpowder Traytors) in King <hi>James</hi> his time, when he came to die, denied what <hi>Garnet</hi> (the Provincial) proved against him, and what he himself had formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed: And <hi>Garnet</hi> denied, upon his Salvation, with horrid imprecations, what Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Old corn,</hi> alias <hi>Hall,</hi> proved against him; and at his Execution, he said he was sorry for dissembling with the Lords of the Council, but excus'd it, by affirming, he did not think they had such proofs against him: These things are evid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt, and appear by the Printed Tryals of those Traytors.</p>
            <p>Here I present thee with a true and faithful account of <hi>William Parry's</hi> Treason, against Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of his behaviour after his Apprehension, upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, and at his Execution, written in the Year of our Lord <hi>1584.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> in his History of <hi>England,</hi> p. <hi>366.</hi> gives us a short Essay of all the remarkable passages thereof, which in this Treatise are more particularly, and at large, set forth, being done by an exact hand immediately after <hi>Parry's</hi> Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cution.</p>
            <p>Peruse it, and thou wilt find, that the Pope and the Cardinal, like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> have joyned hand in hand in wickedness, endeavouring, by hook or by crook, to bring Popery into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that confederation with Foreign Powers hath heretofore been entred into to root out Protestant Religion; Popish Forces uniting to cut off us poor Hereticks.</p>
            <p>And that 'tis commendable to destroy the Prince, and overthrow the Government, to make way for the Popes Supremacy, and the Churches Ʋsurpation.</p>
            <p>Nay, that 'tis part of the Religion of Rome to commit Treason; the greatest Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Mankind being the chiefest Darlings of that Church.</p>
            <p>And that the Laity, aswell as the Clergy, may be influenc'd so far by the power of wicked Principles, as to Espouse the interest of the Church, to the loss of their Allegiance.</p>
            <p>Read on, and thou wilt likewise find, that the Papists formerly have had brows of Brass as well as wanted bowels of Compassion, and have been as unwilling to confess Treason as forward to commit it.</p>
            <p>And that the Papist, after he hath acknowledg'd his guilt, can deny his Confession, and impudently contradict, what himself hath freely owned: For should he suffer as an evil doer, he might forfeit the title of his Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>And that 'tis no new thing for a Papist to tell a lye with his dying breath; Rather than a true Roman Confessor will be foiled, his last words shall be the falsest: For they that are nurst at <hi>Rome,</hi> are educated at <hi>Crete,</hi> and are as infamus for their Lies as their Blood-shed.</p>
            <p>Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> keep such a Religion to her self, and God preserve these Nations from it, that we and our Posterity may enjoy our true Religion, our Laws, our Estates, our Liberties and our Lives: And let all good Protestants say Amen.</p>

            <head>A true and plain DECLARATION OF THE Horrible Treasons Practised by <hi>WILLIAM PARRY</hi> Against the Queens Majesty; AND OF His Conviction and Execution for the same, The 2d. of <hi>March</hi> 1584. according to the account of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>William Parry</hi> being a man of very mean and base Parentage, but of a most proud and insolent Spirit, bearing himself always far above the measure of his Fortune, after he had long led a wasteful and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute life, and had committed a great Outrage against one <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> a Gentleman of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> with an intent to have murthered him in his own Chamber, for the which he was most justly convicted; seeing himself generally condemned with all good men for the same, and other his Misdemeanours, he left his natural Country, and gave himself to travel into forreign parts beyond the Seas. In the course of this his Travel, he forsook his Allegiance and dutiful Obedience to her Majesty, and was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and subjected himself to the Pope. After which, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with certain <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and others of like quality, he first conceived his most detestable Treason to kill the Queen (whose life God long preserve;) which he bound himself by Promise, Letters, and Vows, to perform and execute: and so with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he returned into <hi>England</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1583; and since that did practise at sundry times to have executed his most devilish purpose and determination: yet covering the same, so much as in him lay, with a vail and pretence of great Loyalty to her Majesty.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon his return into <hi>England,</hi> he sought to have secret Access to her Majesty, pretending to have some matter of great importance to reveal unto her: which obtained, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:207717:4"/> same so privately in her Highness's Palace at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> as her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty had but one onely Counsellor with her at the time of his Access, in a remote place, who was so far distant, as he could not hear his Speech. And there then he discovered unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty (but shadowed with all crafty and traiterous skill he had) some part of the Conference and Proceeding, as well with the said <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and other Ministers of the Popes, as especially with one <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> a Fugitive, residing at <hi>Paris,</hi> who above all others did perswade him to proceed in that most devilish Attempt, (as is set down in his voluntary Confession following,) bearing her Majesty notwithstanding in hand, That his onely intent of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding so far with the said <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and the Popes Ministers, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to no other end, but to discover the dangerous Practices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised and attempted against her Majesty by her disloyal Subjects, and other malicious persons in forraign parts. Albeit it hath since appeared most manifestly, as well by his said Confession, as by his dealing with one <hi>Edmond Nevil</hi> Esq; That his onely intent of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the same in sort as he craftily and traiterously did, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to no other end, but to make the way the easier to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his most devilish and wicked purpose.</p>
            <p>And although any other Prince but her Majesty (who is loath to put on a hard Censure of those that protest to be loyal, as <hi>Parry</hi> did,) would rather have proceeded to the punishment of a Subject that had waded so far, as by Oath and Vow to promise the taking away of her life (as he to her Majesties self did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess;) yet such was her goodness, as instead of punishing, she did deal so graciously with him, as she suffered him not onely to have Access unto her presence, but also many times to have private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with her; and did offer unto him, upon opinion once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his fidelity towards her (as though his wicked pretence had been, as he protested, for her service) a most liberal Pension.</p>
            <p>Besides, to the end that he might not grow hateful to the good and well-affected Subjects of the Realm, (from whom he could in no sort have escaped with safety of his life, if his devilish purpose had been revealed) her Majesty did conceal the same, without communicating it to any creature, untill such time as he himself had opened the same unto certain of her Council; and that it was also discovered, that he sought to draw the said <hi>Nevil</hi> to have been a party in his devilish and most wicked purpose.</p>
            <p>A very rare Example! and such as doth more set forth the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular goodness and bounty of her Majesties Princely nature, than
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:207717:4"/> commend (if it be lawful for a Subject to censure his Soveraign) her providence such as ought to be in a Prince and person of her Majesties wisdom and quality. And as the goodness of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties nature did hereby most manifestly shew it self to be rare in so extraordinary a case, and in a matter of so great peril unto her own Royal Person; so did the malice of <hi>Parry</hi> most evidently appear to be in the highest and extreamest degree: who notwithstanding the said extraordinary grace and favour extended towards him, did not onely perswade the said <hi>Nevil</hi> to be an Associate in the said wicked Enterprize, but did also very vehemently (as <hi>Nevil</hi> confesseth) importune him therein, as an Action lawful, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and meritorious, omitting nothing that might provoke him to assent thereunto.</p>
            <p>But such was the singular goodness of Almighty God, (who even from her Majesties Cradle, by many evident Arguments, hath shewed himself her onely and especial Protector) that he so wrought in <hi>Nevil</hi>'s heart, as he was moved to reveal the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Majesty; and for that purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e made choise of a faithful Gentleman, and of good quality in the Court, unto whom upon <hi>Munday</hi> the 8th of <hi>February</hi> last, he discovered at large all that had passed between <hi>Parry</hi> and him; who immediately made it known to her Majesty: whereupon her Highnesses pleasure was, That <hi>Nevil</hi> should be examined by the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Hatton;</hi> who in the evening of the same day did examine him; and he affirmed constantly all which he had before declared to the said Gentleman.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, her Majesty continued her singular and most Princely magnanimity, neither dismaid with the rareness of the Accident, nor appaled with the horrour of so villanous an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, tending even to the taking away of her most gracious life; (a matter especially observed by the Counsellor that was present at such time as <hi>Parry,</hi> after his return, did first discover unto her Majesty his wicked purpose; who found no other alteration in her countenance, than if he had imparted unto her some matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;) which sheweth manifestly how she reposeth her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence wholly in the defence of the Almighty. And so her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, following the wonted course of her singular Clemency, gave order that <hi>Parry</hi> the same <hi>Munday</hi> in the evening (though not so known to him) should be sent to Mr. Secretaries house in <hi>London,</hi> he being then there; who according unto such direction as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her Majesty, did let him understand, That her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:207717:5"/> (in respect of the good will she knew he bare unto the said <hi>Parry,</hi> and of the Trust that <hi>Parry</hi> did outwardly profess to repose in Mr. Secretary) had made especial choice of him to deal with him in a matter that concerned her highly; and that she doubted not but that he would discharge his duty towards her, according unto that extraordinary devotion that he professed to bear unto her.</p>
            <p>And thereupon told him that her Majesty had been advertised that there was somewhat intended presently against her own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wherewith she thought he could not but be made acquainted, considering the great Trust that some of her worst-affected Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects reposed in him; and that her pleasure therefore was, That he should declare unto him his knowledge therein: and whether the said <hi>Parry</hi> himself had let fall any speech unto any person (though with an intent onely to have discovered his disposition) that might draw him in suspition, as though he himself had any such wicked intent. But <hi>Parry</hi> with great and vehement prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations denied it utterly; whereupon Mr. Secretary, the rather to induce him to deal more plainly in a matter so important, declared unto him, That there was a Gentleman of Quality, every way as good or better than himself, and rather his Friend than Enemy, that would avouch it to his face: Yet <hi>Parry</hi> persisted stubbornly in his former denial, and justification of his own innocency; and would not in any respect yield that he was party or privy to any such Motion, Enterprize, or intent. And being lodged that night at Mr. Secretaries house, the next morning he desired earnestly to have some further speech with Mr. Secretary; which granted, <hi>Parry</hi> declared to him, that he had called to remembrance that he had once some speech with one <hi>Nevil</hi> a Kinsman of his (so he called him) touching a point of Doctrine contained in the Answer made to the Book, entituled, <hi>The Execution of Justice in</hi> England; by which book it was resolved, That it was lawful to take away the Life of a Prince, in furtherance of the Catholick Religion: But he protested that they never had any speech at all of any Attempt intended against her Majesties Person. Which Denial of his (at two sundry times, after so much light given him) doth set forth most apparently both the Justice and Providence of God: His Justice, for that (though he was one of a sharp conceit) he had no power to take hold of this Overture, thereby to have avoided the danger that <hi>Nevil</hi>'s Accusation might bring him into by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the same, as a thing propounded onely to feel <hi>Nevil</hi>'s mind,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:207717:5"/> whom before he had reported unto Master Secretary he found a person discontented, and therefore his Confession might to very great purpose have served to have cleared himself touching the intent: His Providence, for that of his great Mercy he would not suffer so dangerous and wicked a member to escape, and to live to Her Majesties peril.</p>
            <p>The same day at Night <hi>Parry</hi> was brought to the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>'s house, and there eftsoons examined before the said Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> Master Vice-Chamberlain, and Master Secretary: He persisted still in his denial of all that he was charged with. Whereupon <hi>Nevil,</hi> being brought before him face to face, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Accusation against him. He notwithstanding would not yet yield to confess it, but very proudly and insolently opposed his Credit against the Credit of <hi>Nevil,</hi> affirming that his <hi>No</hi> was as good as <hi>Nevil</hi>'s <hi>Yea;</hi> and as by way of recrimination, objected the Crime to <hi>Nevil</hi> himself. On the other side, <hi>Nevil</hi> did with great Constancy affirm all that he had before said, and did set down many probable Circumstances of the Times, Places, and Manners of their sundry Conferences, and of such other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as had happened between them in the course of that Action. Whereupon <hi>Parry</hi> was then committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and <hi>Nevil</hi> commanded by their Honours to set down in writing under his Hand, all that which before he had delivered by words: which he did with his own hand, as followeth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WIlliam Parry</hi> the last Summer, soon after his repulse in his Suit for the Mastership of St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> repaired to my Lodging in the <hi>White Friars,</hi> where he shewed himself a person greatly discontented, and vehemently inveighed against Her Majesty, and willed me to assure my self, that during this time and state, I should never receive Contentment. But sith, said he, I know you to be Honourably descended, and a Man of Resolution, if you will give me assurance, either to joyn with me, or not to discover me, I will deliver unto you the only means to do your self good. Which when I had promised him, he appointed me to come the next day to his House in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:207717:6"/>
                     <hi>Fetterlane:</hi> and repairing thither accordingly, I found him in his Bed; whereupon he commanded his men forth, and began with me in this order. <hi>My Lord,</hi> said he, (for so he called me) <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test before God, that three Reasons principally do induce me to enter into this Action, which I intend to discover unto you; the replanting of Religion, the preferring of the</hi> Scotish <hi>Title, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Justice, wonderfully corrupted in this Commowealth:</hi> And thereupon entred into some Discourses what places were fit to be taken, to give entrance to such Forreign Forces as should be best liked of, for the furtherance of such Enterprizes as were to be undertaken. And with these Discourses he passed the time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he went to Dinner: after which, the Company being retired, he entred into his former discourses. <hi>And if I be not deceived,</hi> (said he) <hi>by taking of</hi> Quinborough-<hi>Castle, we shall hinder the passage of the Queens Ships forth of the River.</hi> Whereunto when he saw me use no contradiction, he shook me by the hand; <hi>Tush,</hi> said he, <hi>this is nothing: If men were resolute, there is an Enterprize of much more moment, and much easier to perform; an Act honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and meritorious to God and the world.</hi> Which seeing me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to know, he was not ashamed to utter in plain terms, to consist in killing of her Majesty: <hi>Wherein,</hi> saith he, <hi>if you will go with me, I will loose my Life, or deliver my Countrey from her bad and tyrannous Government.</hi> At which Speeches finding me discontented, he asked me, if I had read Doctor <hi>Allen</hi>'s Book, out of which he alledged an Authority for it. I answered, <hi>No, and that I did not believe that Authority.</hi> Well, said he, what will you say, if I shew further Authority than this, even from <hi>Rome</hi> itself a plain Dispensation for the killing of her, wherein you shall finde it (as I said before) meritorious? <hi>Good Cousin,</hi> said I, <hi>when you shall shew it me, I shall think it very strange, when I shall see one to hold that for meritorious, which another holdeth for damnable.</hi> Well, said <hi>Parry,</hi> do me but the favour to think upon it till to morrow: And if one man be in the Town, I will not fail to shew you the thing it self: and if he be not, he will be within these five or six days; at which time if it please you to meet me at <hi>Chanon-row,</hi> we may there receive the Sacrament to be true each to other, and then I will discover unto you both the party, and the thing itself. Whereupon I prayed <hi>Parry</hi> to think better upon it, as a matter of great charge both of Soul and Body. I would to God, said <hi>Parry,</hi> you were as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly perswaded in it as I am, for then undoubtedly you should do God great service.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:207717:6"/>
                  <p>Not long after, eight or ten days, (as I remember) <hi>Parry</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to visit me at my lodging in <hi>Herns</hi> rents in Holborn, as he often used, we walked forth into the fields, where he renewed again his determination to kill her Majesty, whom he said he thought most unworthy to live, and that he wondred I was so scrupulous therein. She hath sought, said he, your ruine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, why should you not then seek to revenge it? I confess, quoth I, that my case is hard, but yet am I not so desperate as to revenge it upon my self, which must needs be the event of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest and unpossible an enterprise. Unpossible, said <hi>Parry,</hi> I wonder at you; for in truth there is not any thing more easie: you are no Courtier, and therefore know not her customs of walking with small train, and often in the Garden very privately, at which time my self may easily have access unto her, and you also when you are known in Court. Upon the fact we must have a Barge ready to carry us with speed down the River, where we will have a ship ready to transport us if it be needfull: but upon my head, we shall never be followed so far. I asked him, How will you escape forth of the Garden? for you shall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to carry any men with you, and the Gates will then be locked, neither can you carry a Dagge without suspition. As for a Dagge, said <hi>Parry,</hi> I care not: my Dagger is enough. And as for my escaping, those that shall be with her, will be so busie about her, as I shall finde opportunity enough to escape, if you be there ready with the Barge to receive me. But if this seem dangerous in respect of your reason before shewed, let it then rest till her coming to St. <hi>James,</hi> and let us furnish our selves in the mean time with men and horse fit for the purpose: we may each of us keep eight or ten men without suspition. And for my part, said he, I shall finde good fellows that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me without suspecting mine intent. It is much, said he, that so many resolute men may do upon the suddain, being well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with each his Case of Dagges: if they were an hundred waiting upon her, they were not able to save her; you coming of the one side and I on the other, and discharging our Dagges upon her, it were unhappy if we should both miss her. But if our Dagges fail, I shall bestir me well with a sword ere she escape me. Whereunto I said, Good Doctor give over this odious enterprise, and trouble me no more with the hearing of that, which in heart I loath so much. I would to God the enterprise were honest, that I might make known unto thee whether I want
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:207717:7"/> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. And not long after, her Majesty came to St. <hi>James</hi>'s; after which, one morning (the day certain I remember not,) <hi>Parry</hi> revived again his former discourse of killing her Majesty, with great earnestness and importunity perswading me to joyn therein: saying, he thought me the onely man of <hi>England</hi> like to perform it, in respect of my valure, as he termed it.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, I made semblance as if I had been more willing to hear him than before, hoping by that means to cause him to deliver his minde to some other that might be witness thereof with me; wherein nevertheless I failed. After all this, on Saturday last, being the sixth of <hi>February,</hi> between the hours of five and six in the afternoon, <hi>Parry</hi> came to my Chamber, and desired to talk with me apart: whereupon we drew our selves to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. And where I had told <hi>Parry</hi> before, that a learned man whom I met by chance in the fields, unto whom I proponed the question touching her Majesty, had answered me that it was an enterprise most villanous and damnable, willing me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my self of it: <hi>Parry</hi> then desired to know that learned mans name, and what was become of him, saying, after a scornful manner, No doubt he was a very wise man, and you wiser in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving him: and said further, I hope you told him not that I had any thing from <hi>Rome.</hi> Yes in truth, said I. Whereunto <hi>Parry</hi> said, I would you had not named me, nor spoken of any thing I had from <hi>Rome.</hi> And thereupon he earnestly perswaded me eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soons to depart beyond the Seas, promising to procure me safe passage into <hi>Wales,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Britain;</hi> whereat we ended. But I then resolved not to do so, but to discharge my conscience, and lay open this his most traiterous and abominable intention against her Majesty: which I revealed in sort as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set down.</p>

                  <p>IN the year 1570. I was sworn her Majesties servant, from which time until the year 1580. I served, honoured, and loved her with as great readiness, devotion, and assurance as any poor subject in <hi>England.</hi> In the end of that year, and until Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer 1582. I had some trouble for the hurting of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the <hi>Temple.</hi> In which action I was so disgraced and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by two great men (to whom I have of late been behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) that I never had contented thought since. There began my misfortune, and here followeth my woful fall.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>July</hi> after, I laboured for licence to travail for three years, which (upon some consideration) was easily obtained. And so in <hi>August,</hi> I went over with doubtful minde of return, for that being suspected in Religion, and not having received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in twenty two years, I began to mistrust my advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>September</hi> I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Church, and advised to live without scandal, the rather, for that it was mistrusted by the English Catholiques, that I had Intelligence with the greatest Councellour of <hi>England.</hi> I staied not long there, but removed to <hi>Lions</hi> (a place of great Traffick) where, because it was the ordinary passage of our Nation to and fro, between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> I was also suspected.</p>
                  <p>To put all men out of doubt of me, and for some other cause,
<pb facs="tcp:207717:8"/> I went to <hi>Millain,</hi> from whence, as a place of some danger (though I found favour there) after I had cleared my conscience, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my self in Religion before the Inquisitor, I went to <hi>Venice.</hi> There I came acquainted with father <hi>Benedicto Palmio, a grave and a learned Jesuite.</hi> By conference with him of the hard state of the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> and by reading of the Book <hi>De per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutione Anglicana,</hi> and other discourses of like argument, 1 <hi>I conceived a possible mean to relieve the afflicted state of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, if the same might be well warranted in religion and conscience by the Pope, or some learned Divines. I asked his opinion; he made it clear, commended my devotion, comforted me in it,</hi> and after a while made me known to the <hi>Nuntio Campeggio,</hi> there resident for his Holiness. <hi>By his means I wrote to the Pope, presented the service,</hi> and sued for a Pasport to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to return safely into <hi>France.</hi> Answer came from Cardinal <hi>Como,</hi> that I might come, and should be welcome. I misliked the warrant, sued for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I was promised: but it came not before my departure to <hi>Lions,</hi> where I promised to stay some time for it. And being indeed desirous to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and loth to go without counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>I desired</hi> Christofero de Salazar, <hi>Secretary to the Catholick King in</hi> Venice, <hi>who had some understanding by conference, of my devotion to the afflicted Catholicks at home and abroad,</hi> to commend me to the Duke <hi>di Nova Terra,</hi> Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> and to the County of <hi>Olivaris Embi,</hi> then Resident for the King his Master in <hi>Rome:</hi> which he promised to do effectually for the one, and did for the other. And so I took my journey towards <hi>Lyons,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came for me an ample Passeport (but somewhat too late,) that I might come and go <hi>in verbo Pontificis per omnes jurisdictones Ecclesiasticas, absque impedimento.</hi> I acquainted some good Fathers there, of my necessity to depart towards <hi>Paris</hi> by promise, <hi>and prayed their advises upon divers points; wherein I was well satisfied.</hi> And so assuring them that his Holiness should hear from me shortly, it was undertaken that I should be excused for that time.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>October</hi> I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where (upon better opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of me amongst my Catholick Country-men) I found my credit well setled, and such as mistrusted me before, ready to trust and imbrace me. And being one day at the Chamber of <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> a Catholick Gentleman (greatly beloved and trusted on that side) amongst other Gentlemen, talking (but in very good sort) of <hi>England,</hi> I was desired by <hi>Morgan</hi> to go up with him to
<pb facs="tcp:207717:8"/> another Chamber, where he brake with me, and told me that it was hoped and looked for, that I should do some service for God and his Church. I answered him, I would do it, if it were to kill the greatest subject in <hi>England;</hi> whom I named, and in truth then hated. No, no, said he, let him live to his greater fall and ruine of his house:</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>It is the Queen I mean. I had him as I wished, and told him it were soon done, if it might be lawfully done, and warranted in the opinion of some learned Divines. And so the doubt once resolved (though as you have heard I was before reasonably well satisfied) I vowed to undertake the enterprise, for the restitution of</hi> England <hi>to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent obedience of the Sea Apostolick.</hi> Divers Divines were named. Doctor <hi>Allein</hi> I desired, <hi>Parsons</hi> I refused. And by chance came Master <hi>Wattes</hi> a learned Priest, with whom I conferred, and was over-ruled.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 For he plainly pronounced (the case onely altered in name) that it was utterly unlawful: with whom many English Priests did agree as I have heard, if it be not altered since <hi>the book made in answer of The execution of the English Justice was published, which I must confess hath taken hard hold in me,</hi> and (I fear me) will do in others, if it be not prevented by more gracious hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the quiet and obedient Catholick subjects, whereof there is good and greater store in <hi>England,</hi> than this age will extinguish. <hi>Well, notwithstanding all these doubts, I was gone so far by letters and conference in</hi> Italy, <hi>that I could not go back, but promised faithfully to perform the enterprise, if his Holiness upon my offer and letters would allow it, and grant me full remission of my sins.</hi> 4 <hi>I wrote my letters the first of</hi> January 1584. <hi>by their computation; took advice upon them in confession of Father</hi> Anibal <hi>a</hi> Codreto <hi>a learned Jesuite in</hi> Paris, <hi>was lovingly embraced, commended, confessed, and communicated at the Jesuites at one altar with the Cardinals of</hi> Vandosmi, <hi>and</hi> Narbone, <hi>whereof I prayed certificate, and enclosed the same in my Letter to his Holiness, to lead him the rather to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve me; which I required by my Letters, in consideration of so great an enterprise undertaken without promise or reward.</hi> 5 <hi>I went with</hi> Morgan <hi>to the Nuntio</hi> Ragazzoni, <hi>to whom I read the Letter and certificate enclosed, sealed it, and left it with him to send to</hi> Rome: <hi>he promised great care of it, and to procure answer: And so lovingly imbraced me, wished me good speed, and promised that I should be remembred at the altar.</hi> 6 <hi>After this I desired</hi> Morgan, <hi>that some special man might be made privy to this matter, lest he dying, and I
<pb facs="tcp:207717:9"/> miscarrying in the execution, and my intent never truly discovered, it might stick for an everlasting spot in my Race.</hi> Divers were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but none agreed upon for fear of beraying. 7 This being done, <hi>Morgan</hi> assured me, that shortly after my departure, <hi>the</hi> L. Fernehurst (<hi>then in</hi> Paris) <hi>should go into</hi> Scotland, <hi>and be ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first news of the Queens fall to enter into</hi> England <hi>with</hi> 20 <hi>or</hi> 30000 <hi>Men</hi> to defend the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (whom, and the King her Son, I do in my conscience acquit of any privity, liking, or consent to this, or any other bad action, for any thing that ever I did know.) I shortly departed for <hi>England,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Rie</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1583. from whence I wrote to the Court, advertised some, that I had a special service to discover to the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; 8 <hi>which I did more to prepare access and credit, than for any care I had of her Person,</hi> though I were fully resolved never to touch her (notwithstanding any Warrant) if by any device, perswasion, or policy she might be wrought to deal more graciously with the Catholicks than she doth, or by our manner of proceeding in Parliament meaneth to do, or any thing yet seen. I came to the Court, (then at <hi>Whitehall,</hi>) prayed audience, had it at large, and very privately discovered to her Majesty this Conspiracy, much to this effect, <hi>though covered with all the skill I had:</hi> she took it doubtfully, I departed with fear. And amongst other things, I cannot forget her Majesties gratious speech then uttered touching the Catholicks, which of late, after a sort I avowed in Parliament: she said to me, that never a Catholick should be troubled for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Supremacy, so long as they lived like good Subjects. Whereby I mistrusted that her Majesty is born in hand, that none is troubled for the one or the other. It may be truly said, that it is better than it hath been, though it be not yet as it should be.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>March</hi> last, while I was at <hi>Greenwich</hi> (as I remember) suing for St. <hi>Katherines, came Letters to me from Cardinal</hi> Como, <hi>dated at</hi> Rome, <hi>the last of</hi> January <hi>before, whereby I found the enterprise commended, and allowed, and my self absolved (in his Holiness name) of all my sins, and willed to go forward in the name of God.</hi> That Letter I shewed to some in Court, who imparted it to the Queen: what it wrought, or may work in her Majesty, God knoweth: onely this I know, 9 that <hi>it confirmed my resolution to kill her, and made it clear in my conscience, that it was lawful and meritorious.</hi> And yet was I determined never to do it, if either policy, practice, perswasion, or motion in Parliament could prevail. I feared to be tempted, and therefore always when I came near her, I left my
<pb facs="tcp:207717:9"/> Dagger at home. 10 <hi>When I looked upon her Majesty, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred her many excellencies, I was greatly troubled: And yet I saw no remedy, for my Vows were in Heaven, my Letters and Promises in Earth,</hi> and the case of the Catholick Recusants, and others, little bettered. Sometimes I said to my self, Why should I care for her? what hath she done for me? have I not spent 10000 Marks since I knew her service, and never had peny by her? It may be said, she gave me my life. But I say (as my case stood) it had been Tyranny to take it: And I fear me it is little less yet. If it please her gratiously to look into my discontentments, I would to Jesus Christ she had it, for I am weary of it. And now to come to an end of this tragical discourse: In <hi>July</hi> I left the Court, utterly rejected, discontented, and as her Majesty might perceive by my passionate Letters, careless of my self, I came to <hi>London:</hi> Doctor Alleins <hi>Book was sent me out of</hi> France: 11 <hi>it redoubled my former conceits: Every word in it was a warrant to a prepared mind: It taught that Kings may be excommunicated, deprived, and violently handled: It proveth that all Wars Civil or Forraign undertaken for Religion, is Honorable.</hi> Her Majesty may do well to read it, and to be out of doubt (if things be not amended) that it is a warning, and a Doctrine full dangerous. This is the Book I shewed, in some places read, <hi>and lent it to my Cousin</hi> Nevil (the accuser) who came often to mine house, put his finger in my Dish, his hand in my Purse; and the night wherein he accused me, was wrapped in my Gown, six moneths at least after we had entred into this Conspiracy: In which space her Majesty, and ten Princes in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces might have been killed. God bless her Majesty from him: for before Almighty God, I joy and am glad in my soul, that it was his hap <hi>to discover me in time,</hi> though there were no danger near.</p>
                  <p>And now to the manner of our meetings. He came to me in the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> and spake to me in this or like sort. Cousin, let us do somewhat, sithens we can have nothing. I offered to joyn with him, and gladly heard him, <hi>hoping because I knew him to be a Catholick, that he would hit upon that I had in my head:</hi> but it fell not out so. He thought the delivery of the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> easie, presuming upon his Credit and Kindred in the North: I thought it dangerous to her, and impossible to men of our fortunes: He fell from that to the taking of <hi>Barwick:</hi> I spake of <hi>Quinborough</hi> and the Navy, rather to entertain him with discourse, than that I cared for those motions, <hi>my head being full
<pb facs="tcp:207717:10"/> of a greater matter:</hi> 12 I told him that I had another manner of Enterprise, more honourable and profitable to us, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Common-wealth, than all these, if he would joyn in it with me, as he presently vowed to do: He pressed to know it; I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to sleep upon the motion: He did so, (and belike over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken) came to me the next morning to my Lodging in <hi>London,</hi> offered to joyn with me, and <hi>took his Oath upon a Bible, to conceal and constantly to pursue the enterprise for the advancement of Religion; which I also did, and meant to perform: the killing of the Queen was the matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The manner and place, to be on Horsback, with eight or ten horses, when she should ride abroad about St. <hi>James,</hi> or some other like place. It was once thought fit in a Garden, and that the escape would be easiest by water into <hi>Shepey,</hi> or some other part: but we resolved upon the first.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This continued as agreed upon many moneths,</hi> until he heard of the death of <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> whose Land and Dignity (whereof he assured himself) bred belike this Conscience in him to discover a Treason in <hi>February,</hi> contrived and agreed upon in <hi>August.</hi> If it cost him not an ambitious Head at last, let him never trust me. He brought a tall Gentleman (whom he commended for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pistolier) to me to <hi>Chanon-Row,</hi> to make one in the match: but I refused to deal with him, being loth to lay my head upon so many hands.</p>
                  <p>Master <hi>Nevil</hi> hath (I think) forgotten, that he did swear to to me at divers times, that all the advancement she could give, should serve but for her scourge, if ever time and occasion should serve: and that though he would not lay hand upon her in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, his heart served him to strike off her Head in the field. Now leaving him to himself, this much (to make an end) I must confess of my self, I did mean to try what might be done in Parliament, to do my best to hinder all hard courses, to have prayed hearing of the Queens Majesty, to move her (if I could) to take compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon her Catholick Subjects; <hi>and when all had failed, to do as I intended.</hi> If her Majesty by this course would have eased them, though she had never preferred me, I had with all comfort and patience born it: 13 but if she had preferred me without ease or care of them, the Enterprise had held.</p>

                  <p>YOur Majesty may see by my voluntary Confession, the dangerous fruits of a discontented minde; and how constantly I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued my first conceived purpose in <hi>Venice,</hi> for the relief of the afflicted Catholicks; continued it in <hi>Lions,</hi> and resolved in <hi>Paris</hi> to put it in adventure, for the Restitution of <hi>England</hi> to the antient Obedience of the See Apostolick. You may see withal, how it is Commended, Allowed, and Warranted in Conscience, Divinity, and Policy, by the Pope and some great Divines: Though it be true or likely, that most of our <hi>English</hi> Divines (less practised in matters of this weight) do utterly mislike and condemn it.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> King is <hi>French,</hi> you know it well enough, you will finde him occupied when he should do you good; he will not loose a Pilgrimage to save you a Crown.

                  </head>
                  <p>MY Lords, now that the Conspiracy is discovered, the Fault confessed, my Conscience cleared, and Minde prepared patiently to suffer the Pains due for so heinous a Crime: I hope it shall not offend you, if crying <hi>Miserere</hi> with the poor Publican, I leave to despair with cursed <hi>Cain.</hi> My Case is rare and strange, and, for any thing I can remember, singular: A natural Subject solemnly to vow the Death of his natural Queen (so born, so known, and so taken by all men) for the Relief of the afflicted Catholicks, and Restitution of Religion. The Matter first conceived in <hi>Venice,</hi> the Service (in general words) presented to the Pope, continued and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken in <hi>Paris;</hi> and lastly, commended and warranted by his Holiness, digested and resolved in <hi>England,</hi> if it had not been prevented by Accusation, or by her Majesties greater Lenity and more gracious Usage of her Catholick Subjects. This is my first and last Offence conceived against my Prince or Country, and doth (I cannot deny) contein all other faults whatsoever. It is now to be punished by Death, or most graciously (beyond all common expectation) to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Death I do confess to have deserved; Life I do (with all Humility) crave, if it may stand with the Queens Honour, and Policy of the Time. To leave so great a Treason unpunished, were strange: To draw it by my Death in example, were dangerous: A sworn Servant to take upon him such an Enterprize, upon such a ground, and by such a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, hath not been seen in <hi>England:</hi> To Indict him, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign him, bring him to the Scaffold, and to publish his Offence, can do no good: To hope that he hath more to discover than is Confessed, or that at his Execution he will unsay any thing he hath written, is in vain: To conclude, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him in time to make some part of amends, were
<pb facs="tcp:207717:11"/> very hard, and against former Experiences. The Question then is, whether it be better to kill him, or (lest the matter be mistaken) upon hope of his amendment to pardon him. For mine own opinion (though partial) I will deliver you my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. The Case is good Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> the Offence is committed against her Sacred Person, and she may (of her Mercy) pardon it without prejudice to any. Then this I say, in few words, as a man more desirous to discharge his troubled Conscience, than to live. Pardon poor <hi>Parry,</hi> and relieve him: for life without living is not fit for him. If this may not be, or be thought dangerous, or dishonourable to the Queens Majesty (as by your favours, I think it full of Honour and Mercy) then I beseech your Lordships (and no other) once to hear me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I be Indicted, and afterwards (if I must dye) humbly to intreat the Queens Majesty to hasten my Trial and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I pray God (with all my heart) may prove as honourable to her, as I hope it shall be happy to me; who will, while I live, (as I have done always) pray to Jesus Christ for her Majesties long and prosperous Reign.</p>

                  <p>RIght honourable Sir, when your Honour demanded me if Mr. <hi>Parry</hi> did ask me, If it was reason to kill the Queen, indeed and verity, then I had no remembrance at all thereof. But since, thinking on the matter, I have called to mind the whole fashion of his dealing with me, and some of his
<pb facs="tcp:207717:12"/> Arguments: for he dealt very craftily with me, I dare not say maliciously. For I did in no ways think of any such design of his, or of any other, and did answer him simply after my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge to the verity of the question. For after that I had answered him twice before, <hi>Quòd omnino non liceret,</hi> he returned late at Even, by reason I was to depart early in the next Morning toward <hi>Chamberie</hi> in <hi>Savoy</hi> where I did remain, and being return'd out of the Close within one of the Classes of the Colledge, he proponed to me of the new matter, with his Reasons and Arguments. First, he alledged the utility of the deed for delivering of so many Catholicks out of misery, and restitution of the Catholick Religion. I answered, that the Scripture answereth thereto, saying, <hi>Non sunt facienda mala, ut veniant bona.</hi> So that for no good, how great that ever it be, may be wrought any evil, how little that ever it be. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that it was not evil to take away so great evil, and induce so great good. I answered, That all good is not to be done, but that onely, <hi>Quod bene &amp; legitime fieri potest.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Dixi, Deum magis amare adverbia quàm nomina. Quia in actionibus magis ei placent bene &amp; legitime, quam bonum. Ita ut nullum bonum liceat facere, nisi bene &amp; legitimè fieri possit. Quod in hoc casu fieri non potest.</hi> Yet said he, that several learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men were of the opinion, <hi>Quod liceret.</hi> I answered, that they men perhaps were of the opinion that for the safety of many in Soul and Body, they would permit a particular to his danger, and to the occult judgment of God: Or perhaps said so, moved rather by some compassion and commiseration of the miserable estate of the Catholicks, not for any such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that they did finde in their Books. For it is certain, that such a thing is not licite to a particular, without special revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Divine, which exceedeth our Learning and Doctrine. And so he departed from me.</p>

                        <head>The manner of the Arraignment of <hi>Will. Parry</hi> the 25th of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1584.</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the place where the Court, commonly called the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> is usually kept, by vertue of her Majesties Commission of Oyer and Terminer, before <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> Governour of <hi>Barwick,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Knolles</hi> Knight, Treasurer of the Queens Majesties Houshold, Sir <hi>James Croft</hi> Knight, Comptroller of the same Houshold, Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi> Knight, Vice-Chamberlain to her Majesty, Sir <hi>Christopher Wray</hi> Knight, Chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard</hi>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:207717:13"/> Knight, Master of the Rolls, Sir <hi>Edmund Anderson</hi> Knight, Chief-Justice of the Common-Pleas, Sir <hi>Roger Manwood</hi> Knight, Chief-Baron of the Exchequer, and Sir <hi>Thomas Hennage</hi> Knight, Treasurer of the Chamber.</head>
                        <p>FIrst, three Proclamations for silence were made, according to the usual course in such cases. Then the Lieutenant was commanded to return his Precept; which did so, and brought the Prisoner to the Bar, to whom <hi>Miles Sandes</hi> Esquire, Clerk of the Crown, said, <hi>William Parry,</hi> hold up thy hand; and he did so. Then said the Clerk of the Crown, Thou art here Indicted by the Oaths of twelve good and lawful men of the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> before Sir <hi>Christopher Wray</hi> Knight, and others, which took the Indictment<note place="margin">The Indictment.</note> by the name of <hi>William Parry,</hi> late of <hi>London,</hi> Gentleman, otherwise called <hi>William Parry,</hi> late of <hi>London,</hi> Doctor of the Law; for that thou, as a false Traitor against the most Noble and Christian Prince, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> thy most gracious Soveraign and Liege-Lady, not having the fear of God before thine eyes, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding thy due Allegiance; but being seduced by the instigation of the Devil, and intending to withdraw and extinguish the hearty Love and due Obedience which true and faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects should bear unto the same our Soveraign Lady, didst at <hi>Westminster</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> on the first day of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> in the 26th year of her Highness Reign, and at divers other times and places in the same County, maliciously and traiterously conspire and compass, not only to deprive and depose the same our Sovereign Lady of her Royal Estate, Title and Dignity; but also to bring her Highness to Death and final Destruction, and Sedition in the Realm to make, and the Government thereof to subvert, and the sincere Religion of God established in her Highness Dominions to alter and subvert. And that, whereas thou <hi>William Parry,</hi> by thy Letters sent unto <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> didst signifie unto the same Bishop thy purposes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions aforesaid, and thereby didst pray and require the same Bishop to give thee Absolution; that thou afterwards, that is to say, the last day of <hi>March</hi> in the 26th year aforesaid, didst trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously receive Letters from one called <hi>Cardinal de Como,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto thee <hi>William Parry,</hi> whereby the same Cardinal did signifie unto thee, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had perused thy Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and allowed of thine intent; and that to that end he had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:207717:14"/> absolved thee of all thy Sins, and by the same Letter did animate and stir thee to proceed with thine Enterprize; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, thou, the last day of <hi>August,</hi> in the 26th year aforesaid, at Saint <hi>Giles in the fields,</hi> in the same County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> didst traiterously confer with one <hi>Edmund Nevil</hi> Esquire, uttering to him all thy wicked and traiterous devises, and then and there didst move him to assist thee therein, and to joyn with thee in those wicked Treasons aforesaid, against the Peace of our said Soveraign Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity. What sayest thou, <hi>William Parry,</hi> Art thou guilty of these Treasons whereof thou standest here Indicted, or not guilty?</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry's</hi> answer to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</note>Then <hi>Parry</hi> said, Before I plead not guilty, or confess my self guilty, I pray you give me leave to speak a few words: and with humbling himself, began in this manner. God save Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and God send me grace to discharge my duty to her, and to send you home in charity. But touching the matters that I am Indicted of, some were in one place, and some in another, and done so secretly, as none can see into them, except that they had eyes like unto God; wherefore I will not lay my Blood upon the Jury, but do minde to confess the Indictment. It containeth but the parts that have been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read, I pray you tell me? Whereunto it was answered, that the Indictment contained the parts he had heard read, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whereupon the Clerk of the Crown said unto <hi>Parry, Parry,</hi> thou must answer directly to the Indictment, whether thou be guilty or not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry</hi> confesseth that he is guilty of all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Indictment.</note>Then said <hi>Parry,</hi> I do confess that I am guilty of all that is therein contained: And further too, I desire not life, but desire to die. Unto which the Clerk of the Crown said, If you confess it, you must confess it in manner and form as it is comprised in the Indictment. Whereunto he said, I do confess it in manner and form as the same is set down, and all the circumstances thereof. Then the Confession being Recorded, the Queens learned Council being ready to pray Judgment upon the same Confession, Master Vice-chamberlain said, These matters contained in this Indictment, and confessed by this man, are of great importance: they touch the Person of the Queens most excellent Majesty in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the very state and well-doing of the whole Common-wealth, and the truth of Gods Word established in these her Majesties Dominions, and the open demonstration of that capital envy of
<pb facs="tcp:207717:14"/> the man of <hi>Rome,</hi> that hath set himself against God and all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, all good Princes and good Government, and against good men. Wherefore, I pray you, for the satisfaction of this great Multitude, let the whole matter appear, that every one may see that the matter of it self is as bad as the Indictment purporteth, and as he hath Confessed. Whereto in respect that the Justice of the Realm hath been of late very impudently slandered, all yielded as a thing necessary to satisfie the world in particular, of that which was but summarily comprised in the Indictment, though in the Law, his Confession served sufficiently to have proceeded thereupon unto Judgment. Whereupon the Lords and others the Commissioners, her Majesties learned Councel, and <hi>Parry</hi> himself agreed, that <hi>Parry</hi>'s Confession (taken the 11th and 13th of <hi>February</hi> 1584. before the Lord of <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> Master Vice-chamberlain, and Master Secretary,) and Cardinal <hi>de Como</hi> his Letters, and <hi>Parry</hi>'s Letters to the Lord Treasurer and Lord Steward, should be openly read.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Parry,</hi> for the better satisfying of the people and standers by, offered to read them himself: but being told that the Order was, the Clerk of the Crown should read them, it was so resolved of all parts. And then Master Vice-chamberlain caused to be shewed to <hi>Parry</hi> his said Confession, the Cardinals Letter, and his own Letter aforesaid; which after he had particularly viewed every leaf thereof, he confessed, and said openly they were the same.</p>
                        <p>Then said Master Vice-chamberlain, Before we proceed to shew what he hath Confessed, what say you, said he to <hi>Parry,</hi> is that which you have Confessed here true and did you Confess it freely and willingly of your self, or was then any extort means used to draw it from you?</p>
                        <p>Surely, said <hi>Parry,</hi> I made that Confession freely without any constraint, and that is all true, and more too: for there is no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that hath been sithens the first year of the Queen, any way touching Religion, saving receipt of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and perswading of others, wherein I have not much dealt, but I have offended in it. And I have also delivered mine opinion in writing, who ought to be Successor to the Crown, which he said to be Treason also.</p>
                        <p>Then his Confession of the eleventh and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>February,</hi> all of his own hand writing,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry's</hi> Confession of his Treasons was read by his own assent.</note> and before particularly set down, was openly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:207717:15"/> and distinctly read by the Clerk of the Crown. And that done, the Cardinal <hi>di Como</hi> his Letter in Italian was delivered unto <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s hand by the direction of Master Vicechamberlain, which <hi>Parry</hi> there perused,<note place="margin">A Letter of Cardinal <hi>di Como</hi> to <hi>Parry,</hi> also read.</note> and openly affirmed to be wholly of the Cardinals own hand writing, and the Seal to be his own also, and to be with a Cardinals Hat on it: And himself did openly read it in <hi>Italian,</hi> as before is set down. And the words bearing sence as it were written to a Bishop, of to a man of such degree, it was demanded of him by Master Vice-Chamberlain, Whether he had not taken the degree of a Bishop? He said, No: But said at first, those terms were proper to the Degree he had taken. And after said, that the Cardinal did vouchsafe, as of a favour, to write so to him. Then the Copy of that Letter in <hi>English,</hi> as before is also set down, was in like manner openly read by the Clerk of the Crown; which <hi>Parry</hi> then acknowledged to be truely translated.</p>
                        <p>And thereupon was shewed unto <hi>Parry</hi> his Letter of the 18th of <hi>February,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry's</hi> Letter of the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> to the Lord Treasurer and the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> read.</note> written to the Lord Treasurer, and the Lord Steward: which he confessed to be all of his own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, and was as before is set down.</p>
                        <p>These matters being read openly, for manifestation of the matter, <hi>Parry</hi> prayed leave to speak: Whereto Master Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamberlain said, <hi>If you will say any thing for the better opening to the world of those your foul and horrible Facts, speak on: but if you mean to make any excuse of that which you have confessed, which else would have been and do stand proved against you, for my part, I will not sit to hear you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then her Majesties Attourney-General stood up and said, <hi>It appeareth before you, my Lords, that this man hath been Indicted and Arraigned of several most hainous and horrible Treasons, and hath confessed them, which is before you of Record; wherefore there resteth no more to be done, but for the Court to give Judgment accordingly,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Queens Atturny requires Judgment.</note>
                           <hi>which here I require in the behalf of the Queens Majesty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then said <hi>Parry, I pray you hear me for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of my Conscience. I will not go about to excuse my self, nor to seek to save my Life, I care not for it; you have my Confession of record, that is enough for my Life. And I mean to utter more, for which I were worthy to die.</hi> And said, <hi>I pray you hear me, in that I am to speak to discharge my Conscience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:207717:15"/>
                        <p>Then said Master Vice-Chamberlain, <hi>Parry,</hi> then do thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to Conscience, and utter all that thou canst say concerning those thy most wicked Facts.</p>
                        <p>Then said <hi>Parry, My cause is rare, singular and unnatural, conceived at</hi> Venice, <hi>presented in general words to the Pope, undertaken at</hi> Paris, <hi>commended and allowed of by his Holiness, and was to have been executed in</hi> England, <hi>if it had not been prevented. Yea, I have committed many Treasons, for I have committed Treason in being reconciled, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in taking Absolution.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry</hi> had for his credit aforetime said very secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he had been soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited beyond the Seas to commit the fact, but he would not do it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he craftily abused both the Queens Majesty, and those two Counsellers whereof he now would help himself with these false Speeches, against most manifest proofs.</note>
                           <hi>There hath been no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sithens the first year of the Queens Reign tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Religion, but that I am guilty of (except for receiving of</hi> Agnus Dei, <hi>and perswading as I have said:) And yet never intended to kill Queen</hi> Elizabeth. <hi>I appeal to her own knowledge, and to my Lord Treasurers, and Master Secretaries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then said my L<seg rend="sup">d</seg>
                           <hi>Hunsdon, Hast thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it so often, and so plainly in writing under thy hand, and here of record; and now, when thou shouldest have thy judgment according to that which thou hast Confessed thy self guilty of, doest thou go back again, and deny the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all? How can we believe that thou now sayest?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then said Master Vice-chamberlain,<note place="margin">Master Vice-chamberlains Speeches, proving mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly <hi>Parry's</hi> Traiterous intentions.</note> This is absurd. Thou hast not onely Confessed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that thou wert guilty according to the Indictment, which summarily, and yet in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words doth contain that thou hadst Traiterously compassed and intended the death and destruction of her Majesty; but thou also saidst particularly that thou wert guilty of every of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons contained therein, whereof the same was one, in plain and express letter set down, and read unto thee. Yea, thou saidst that thou wert guilty of more Treasons too besides these. And didst thou not upon thy examination voluntarily confess, how thou wast moved first thereunto by mislike of thy state after thy departure out of the Realm, And that thou didst mislike her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty for that she had done nothing for thee; How by wicked Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Popish Books, thou wert perswaded that it was lawful to kill her Majesty; How thou wert by reconciliation become one of that wicked sort, that held her Majesty for neither lawful Queen nor Christian, And that it was meritorious to kill her? And didst thou not signifie that thy purpose to the Pope by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and, receivedst Letters from the Cardinal, how he allowed of
<pb facs="tcp:207717:16"/> thine intent, and excited thee to perform it, and thereupon didst receive Absolution? And didst thou not conceive it, promise it, vow it, swear it, and receive the Sacrament that thou wouldst do it? And didst not thou thereupon affirm, that thy Vows were in Heaven, and thy Letters and Promises on Earth to binde thee to do it? And that whatsoever her Majesty would have done for thee, could not have removed thee from that intention or purpose, unless she would have desisted from dealing as she hath done with the Catholicks, as thou callest them? All this thou hast plainly Confessed: And I protest before this great Assembly, thou hast Confessed it more plainly and in better sort, than my memory will serve me to utter: And saist thou now, that thou never meant'st it?</p>
                        <p>Ah, said <hi>Parry,</hi> your Honours know, how my Confession upon mine Examination was extorted.</p>
                        <p>Then both the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> and Master Vice-Chamberlain affirmed, that there was no Torture or threatning words offered him.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Parry</hi> then said, that they told him, that if he would not confess willingly, he should have torture: whereunto their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours answered, that they used not any speech or word of torture to him.</p>
                        <p>You said, said <hi>Parry,</hi> that you would proceed with rigour against me, if I would not confess it of my self.</p>
                        <p>But their Honours expresly affirmed, that they used no such words. But I will tell thee, said Master Vice-chamberlain, what we said. I spake these words: If you will willingly utter the truth of your self, it may do you good, and I wish you to do so: If you will not, we must then proceed in ordinary course to take your Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereunto you answered, that you would tell the truth of your self.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry</hi> reproved of false Speeches, and so by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also confessed.</note> Was not this true? Which then he yielded unto.</p>
                        <p>And hereunto, her Majesties Attourney-General put <hi>Parry</hi> in remembrance what Speeches he used to the Lieutenant of the Tower, the Queens Majesties Serjeant at Law, Master <hi>Gaudie,</hi> and the same Attourney, on Saturday the twentieth of <hi>February</hi> last, at the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon that he was by them then examined by Order from the Lords: which was, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd he was most mildly and favourably dealt with, in all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations: which he also at the Bar then acknowledg'd to be true.</p>
                        <p>Then Master Vice-chamberlain said, that it was wonder to see the magnanimity of her Majesty, which after that thou hadst
<pb facs="tcp:207717:16"/> opened those Trayterous Practices in sort as thou hast laid it down in thy Confession, was nevertheless such, and so far from all fear, as that she would not so much as acquaint any one of her Highness Privy-Council with it, to his knowledge, no not until after this thine Enterprise discovered and made manifest. And besides that which thou hast set down under thine own hand, thou didst confess, that thou hadst prepared two <hi>Scottish</hi> Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, fit for such a purpose; and those being disposed away by thee, thou didst say, that another would serve thy turn. And withal, <hi>Parry,</hi> didst thou not also confess before us, how wonderfully thou wert appaled and perplexed upon a sudden, at the presence of her Majesty at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> this last Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, saying, that thou didst think, thou then sawest in her, the very likeness and image of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh? And that therewith, and upon some Speeches used by her Majesty, thou didst turn about and weep bitterly to thy self? And yet didst call to minde that thy Vows were in Heaven, thy Letters and Promises on Earth; and that therefore thou didst say with thy self, that there was no remedy but to do it? Didst thou not confess this? The which he acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>Then said the Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The L. of <hi>Hunsdon's</hi> Speeches, convincing <hi>Parry</hi> manifestly of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note>
                           <hi>Sayest thou now, that thou didst never mean to kill the Queen? Didst thou not confess, that when thou didst utter this practice of treachery to her Majesty, that thou didst cover it with all the skill thou hadst, and that it was done by thee, rather to get credit and access thereby, than for any regard thou hadst of her Person? But in truth thou didst it, that thereby thou mightest have better opportunity to perform thy wicked Enterprise. And wouldest thou have run into such fear as thou didst confess that thou wert in, when thou didst utter it, if thou hadst never meant it? What reason canst thou shew for thy self?</hi> With that he cryed out in a furious manner, <hi>I never meant to kill her: I will lay my Blood upon Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>and you, before God and the World:</hi> And thereupon fell into a rage and evil words with the Queens Majesties Attourney-General.</p>
                        <p>Then said the Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> This is but thy Popish Pride and Ostentation, which thou wouldst have to be told to thy fellows of that Faction, to make them believe that thou diest for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, when thou diest for most horrible and dangerous Treasons against her Majesty, and thy whole Country. For thy laying of thy Bloud, it must lye on thine own Head, as a just Reward
<pb facs="tcp:207717:17"/> of thy wickedness. The Laws of the Realm most justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee to die, out of thine own mouth, for the conspiring the Destruction both of her Majesty, and of us all: Therefore thy Bloud be upon thee; neither her Majesty nor we at any time sought it, thy self hast spilt it.</p>
                        <p>Then he was asked, What he could say, why Judgment of Death ought not to be awarded against him.</p>
                        <p>Whereto he said, he did see that he must die, because he was not settled.</p>
                        <p>What meanest thou by that, said Master Vice-Chamberlain? Said he, Look into your Study, and into your new Books, and you shall finde what I mean.</p>
                        <p>I protest (said his Honour) I know not what thou meanest: thou dost not well to use such dark Speeches, unless thou wouldst plainly utter what thou meanest thereby. But he said, he cared not for Death, and that he would lay his Bloud amongst them.</p>
                        <p>Then spake the Lord Chief-Justice of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Lord Chief-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices Speech to <hi>Parry.</hi>
                           </note> being required to give the Judgment, and said, <hi>Parry,</hi> you have been much heard, and what you mean by being settled, I know not; but I see you are so settled in Popery, that you cannot settle your self to be a good Subject. But touching that you should say, to stay Judgment from being given against you, your Speeches must be of one of these kinds, either to prove the Indictment (which you have confessed to be true) to be insufficient in Law; or else to plead somewhat touching her Majesties Mercy, why Justice should not be done of you. All other Speeches, wherein you have used great Liberty, is more than by Law you can ask. These be the matters you must look to, what say you to them? Whereto he said nothing.</p>
                        <p>Then said the Lord Chief-Justice, <hi>Parry,</hi> thou hast been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time Indicted of divers most horrible and hateful Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, committed against thy most gracious Soveraign and Native Country: the matter most detestable, the manner most subtle and dangerous, and the occasions and means that led thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, most ungodly and villanous. That thou didst intend it, it is most evident by thy self. The matter was the destruction of a most Sacred and an Anointed Queen, thy Sovereign and Mistriss, who hath shewed thee such Favour, as some thy betters have not obtained: Yea, the Overthrow of thy Country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou wert born, and of a most happy Commonwealth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:207717:17"/> thou art a Member, and of such a Queen, as hath bestowed on thee the Benefit of all benefits in this world, that is, thy Life, heretofore granted thee by her Mercy, when thou hadst lost it by Justice and Desert. Yet: thou her Servant, sworn to defend her, meant'st with thy bloudy hand to have taken away her Life, that mercifully gave thee thine, when it was yielded into her hands: This is the matter wherein thou hast offended. The manner was most subtle and dangerous, beyond all that before thee have committed any Wickedness against her Majesty. For thou, making shew as if thou wouldest simply have uttered for her safety the Evil that others had contrived, didst but seek thereby credit and access, that thou mightest take the apter opportunity for her Destruction. And for the occasions and means that drew thee on, they were most ungodly and villanous, as the perswasions of the Pope, of Papists, and Popish Books. The Pope pretendeth that he is a Pastor, when as in truth, he is far from feeding of the Flock of Christ; but rather as a Wolf, seeketh but to feed on and to suck out the blood of true Christians, and as it were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth after the bloud of our most Gracious and Christian Queen. And these Papists and Popish Books, while they pretend to set forth Divinity, they do indeed most ungodly teach and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, that which is quite contrary both to God and his Word. For the Word teaches Obedience of Subjects towards Princes, and forbideth any private man to kill: But they teach Subjects to disobey Princes, and that a private wicked person may kill; yea, and whom? A most godly Queen, and their own natural and most gracious Soveraign. Let all men therefore take heed how they receive any thing from him, hear or read any of their Books, and how they confer with any Papists. God grant her Majesty, that she may know by thee, how ever she trust such like to come so near her Person. But see the end, and why thou didst it; and it will appear to be a most miserable, fearful, and foolish thing: For thou didst imagine, that it was to relieve those, that thou callest Catholicks, who were most likely amongst all others to have felt the worst of it, if thy devilish practice had taken effect. But sith thou hast been Indicted of the Treasons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in the Indictment, and thereupon Arraigned,<note place="margin">The Form of the Judgment against the Traitor.</note> and hast confessed thy self Guilty of them, the Court doth award, that thou shalt be had from hence to the place whence thou didst come, and so drawn through the open City of <hi>London</hi> upon an Hurdle to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:207717:18"/> and there to be hanged and let down alive, and thy privy parts cut off, and thy entrals taken out and burnt in thy fight, then thy Head to be cut off, and thy Body to be divided in four parts, and to be disposed at her Majesties pleasure: And God have mercy on thy Soul.</p>

                           <hi>Parry</hi> nevertheless persisted still in his rage and fond Speech, and ragingly there said, he there summoned Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to answer for his Blood before God: wherewith, the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> was commanded to take him from the Bar, and so he did. And upon his departure, the people stricken as it were at heart with the horror of his intended Enterprise, ceased not, but pursued him with out-cryes, as, Away with the Traitor, away with him, and such like: whereupon he was conveyed to the Barge, to pass to the <hi>Tower</hi> again by water, and the Court was adjorned.</p>

            <head>An addition not unnecessary for this purpose.</head>
            <p>FOr as much as <hi>Parry</hi> in the abundance of his proud and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant humour, hath often both in his Confession, and Letters, pretended some great and grievous causes of discontentment against her Majesty, and the present State: It shall not be impertinent, for better satisfaction of all persons, to set forth simply and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the condition and quality of the man, what he was by Birth and Education, and in what course of life he had lived.</p>
            <p>This vile and Traiterous Wretch was one of the younger Sons of a poor man, called <hi>Harry ap David:</hi> he dwelled in <hi>North-Wales</hi> in a little Village called <hi>Northoppe,</hi> in the County of <hi>Flint:</hi> there he kept a common Ale-house, which was the best and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est stay of his living. In that house was this Traitor Born, his Mother was the reputed Daughter of one <hi>Conway</hi> a Priest, Parson of a poor Parish called <hi>Halkin,</hi> in the same County of <hi>Flint:</hi> his his eldest Brother dwelleth at this present in the same House, and there keepeth an Ale-house as his Father did before him. This Traitor in his Childhood, so soon as he had learned a lttle to Write &amp; Read, was put to serve a poor man dwelling in <hi>Chester,</hi> named <hi>John Fisher,</hi> who professed to have some small skill and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Law. With him he continued divers years, and served as a Clerk, to write such things, as in that Trade which his master used, he was appointed. During this time, he learned the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and at such times of leasure, as the poor man his Master had no occasion otherwise to use him, he was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go to the Grammer-School, where he got some little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in the Latin Tongue. In this his Childhood he was noted by such as best knew him, to be of a most villanous and dangerous nature and disposition. He did often run away from his Master, and was often taken and brought to him again. His Master, to correct his perverse and froward conditions, did many times shut him as Prisoner in some close place of his house, and many times caused him to be chained, locked, and clogged, to stay his running away. Yet all was in vain: For about the third year of her Majesties Reign, for his last farewel to his poor Master, he ran away from him, and came to <hi>London</hi> to seek his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He was then constrained to seek what Trade he could to live by, and to get meat and drink for his belly, and cloaths for his back. His good hap in the end was to be entertained in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:207717:19"/> place of Service above his Desert; where he staid not long, but shifted himself divers times from Service to Service, and from one Master to another. Now he began to forget his old Home, his Birth, his Education, his Parents, his Friends, his own Name, and what he was. He aspired to greater matters, he challenged the Name and Title of a great Gentleman, he vaunted himself to be of Kin and allied to Noble and Worshipful; he left his old Name, which he did bear and was commonly called by in his Childhood, and during all the time of his abode in the Country, which was <hi>William ap Harry</hi> (as the manner in <hi>Wales</hi> is.) And because he would seem to be indeed the man which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he took upon him the Name of <hi>Parry,</hi> being the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of divers Gentlemen of great Worship and Honour. And because his Mothers Name by her Father (a Priest) was <hi>Conway,</hi> he pretended Kindred to the Family of Sir <hi>John Conway,</hi> and so thereby made himself of kin to <hi>Edmund Nevil.</hi> Being thus set forth with his new Name and new Title of Gentleman, and commended by some of his good Favourers, he matched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Marriage with a Widow in <hi>South-Wales,</hi> who brought him some reasonable Portion of Wealth. She lived with him but a short time, and the wealth he had with her lasted not long: it was soon consumed with his dissolute and wastful manner of life. He was then driven to his wonted shifts, his Creditors were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Debt which he owed great, he had nothing wherewith to make Payment, he was continually pursued by Serjeants and Officers to Arrest him, he did often by slights and shifts escape from them. In this his needy and poor estate, he sought to repair himself again by a new match in Marriage with another Widow, which before was the Wife of one <hi>Richard Heywood;</hi> this matter was so earnestly followed by himself, and so effectually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by his Friends and Favourers, that the Woman yielded to take him to Husband: a Match in every respect very unequal and unfit; her Wealth and yearly Livelihood was very great, his poor and base Estate worse than nothing; he very young, she of such age, as for years she might have been his Mother. When he had thus possessed himself of his new Wives wealth, he omitted nothing that might serve for a prodigal, dissolute, and most ungodly course of Life. His Riot and Excess was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable; he did most wickedly deflower his Wives own Daughter, and sundry ways pitifully abuse the old Mother: He carried himself for his outward port and countenance (so long as
<pb facs="tcp:207717:19"/> his Old wives Bags lasted) in such sort, as might well have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for a man of very good haviour and degree. But this lasted not long; his proud heart and wastful hand had foon poured out old <hi>Heywood</hi>'s Wealth. He then fell again to his wonted shifts, borrowed where he could finde any to lend, and engaged his Credit so far as any would trust him. Amongst others, he became greatly indebted to <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man before-named; who after long forbearing of his Money, sought to recover it by ordinary means of Law. For this cause <hi>Parry</hi> conceived great displeasure against him, which he pursued with all Malice, even to the seeking of his Life. In this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous intent, he came in the night-time to Mr. <hi>Hares</hi> Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi> broke open the door, assaulted him, and wounded him grievously, and so left him in great danger of Life. For this Offence he was Apprehended, Committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of Burglary, Arraigned, and found Guilty by a very substantial Jury,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Parry</hi> Condemned for Burglary, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of the Queen.</note>
               <hi>and Condemned to be Hanged, as the Law in that Case requireth.</hi> He standing thus Convicted, her Majesty, of her most gracious Clemency, and pitiful Disposition, took com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion upon him, pardoned his Offence, and gave him his Life, which by the Law and due course of Justice he ought then to have lost. After this he tarried not long, but pretending some causes of discontentment, departed the Realm, and travelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas. How he demeaned himself there from time to time, and with whom he conversed, is partly in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession touched before. This is the man, this is his Race, which he feared should be spotted, if he miscarried in the execution of his Traiterous Enterprise; this hath been the course of his Life, these are the great causes of his Discontentment.</p>
            <p>And whereas at his Arraignment and Execution, he pretended great care of the disobedient Popish Subjects of this Realm, whom he called Catholicks, and in very insolent sort seemed to glory greatly in the Profession of his pretensed Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: The whole course and action of his Life sheweth plainly, how profanely and irreligiously he did always bear himself. He vaunted, that for these two and twenty years past he had been a Catholick, and during all that time never received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: Yet before he travelled beyond the Seas, at three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times within the compass of those two and twenty years, he did voluntarily take the Oath of Obedience to the Queens Majesty, set down in the Statute made in the first year of her Highness
<pb facs="tcp:207717:20"/> Reign; by which, amongst other things, he did testifie and declare in his Conscience, that no Forreign Prince, Person, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, State, or Potentate, hath or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Preeminence, or Authority, Ecclesiastical or Spiritual, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realm; and therefore did utterly renounce and forsake all Forreign Jurisdictions, Powers, and Authorities; and did promise to bear Faith and true Allegeance to the Queens High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, her Heirs and lawful Successors.</p>
            <p>With what Conscience or Religion he took that Oath so often, if he were then a Papist indeed, as sithence the discovery of his Treasons he pretended, let his best friends the Papists themselves judge. But perhaps it may be said, that he repented those his Offences past; that since those three Oaths so taken by him, he was twice reconciled to the Pope, and so his Conscience cleared, and he become a new man; and (which is more) that in the time of his last Travel, he cast away all his former lewd manners: that he changed his degree and habit, and bought or begged the grave Title of a Doctor of Law, for which he was well qualified with a little Grammar-School <hi>Latine;</hi> that he had Plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and Remission of all his Sins, in consideration of his undertaking of so holy an Enterprise as to kill Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a sacred anointed Queen, his Natural and Soveraign Lady: That he promised to the Pope, and vowed to God to perform it: that he confirmed the same by receiving the Sacrament at the Jesuits, at one Altar with his two <hi>Beaupeers,</hi> the Cardinals of <hi>Vendosme</hi> and <hi>Narbonne:</hi> And that since his last return into <hi>England,</hi> he did take his Oath upon the Bible to execute it. These Reasons may seem to bear some weight indeed amongst his Friends the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, and other Papists of State, who have special Skill in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such importance.</p>
            <p>But now lately in the beginning of this Parliament in <hi>November</hi> last, he did eftsoons solemnly in publick place take the Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, of obedience to her Majesty. How that may stand with his reconciliations to the Pope, and with his Promises, Vows, and Oath to kill the Queen, it is a thing can hardly be warranted, unless it be by some special priviledge of the Popes omnipotency.</p>
            <p>But let him have the glory he desired, to live and die a Papist. He deserved it, it is fit for him, his death was correspondent to the course of his life, which was disloyal, perjured, and Traiterous towards her Majesty, and false and perfidious towards the Pope himself, and his Catholicks, if they will believe his solemn protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:207717:20"/> which he made at his Arraignment and Execution, that he never meant nor intended any hurt to her Highness Person. For if that be true, where are then his Vows which he said were in Heaven, his Letters and Promise upon Earth? Why hath he stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out of the Popes shop so large an Indulgence and plenary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all his Sins, and meant to perform nothing that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised? Why was his Devotion and Zeal so highly commended? Why was he so specially prayed for and remembred at the Altar? All these great favours were then bestowed upon him without cause or desert: for he deceived the Pope, he deceived the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and Jesuites, with a false semblance, and pretence to do that thing which he never meant.</p>
            <p>But the matter is clear, the Conspiracy, and his traiterous intent is too plain and evident: it is the Lord that revealed it in time, and prevented their malice: there lacked no will, or readiness in him to execute that horrible fact. It is the Lord that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served her Majesty from all the wicked Practices and Conspiracies of that Hellish Rabble: it is he that hath most gratiously deliver'd her from the hands of this Traiterous miscreant. The Lord is her onely defence, in whom she hath always trusted.</p>
